# To-Do - (vue-components)

## Desktop / Mobile Only Styles
In addition to a 'styles' prop that effects both desktop and mobile.\
We need extra style props for targeting only Desktop or Mobile.

## Create 'Button' module
Should have styles set via props to make it fully customisable.

---

## Create 'Video' module
Will need to have a watcher, to re-render the video component if the 'src' prop changes.
